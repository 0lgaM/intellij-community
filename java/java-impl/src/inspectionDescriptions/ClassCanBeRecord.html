Suggests replacing classes with records.
<p>The inspection can be useful if you need to focus on modeling immutable data rather than extensible behavior.
  Automatic implementation of data-driven methods, such as equals and accessors, helps to get rid of boilerplate.</p>
<p>
  Note that not every class can be a record. Here are some of the restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A class must contain no inheritors and must be a top-level class.</li>
  <li>All the non-static fields in class must be final.</li>
  <li>Class must contain no instance initializers, generic constructors, nor native methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a full list of the restrictions, refer to the
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/preview/specs/records-jls.html">Oracle documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  class Point {
    private final double x;
    private final double y;

    Point(double x, double y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
    }

    double getX() {
      return x;
    }

    double getY() {
      return y;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This record will be converted to:</p>
<pre><code>
  record Point(int x, int y) {
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Enable <b>Suggest renaming get/is-accessors</b> checkbox to allow renaming <code>getX()</code>/<code>isX()</code> accessors to <code>x()</code> automatically.</p>
<p>
  Use <b>When conversion weakens the member access level</b> option to set up the conversion behavior if one may violate class encapsulation:
<ul>
  <li>Choose <b>Do not suggest conversion</b> option to suppress conversion if one violates class encapsulation</li>
  <li>Choose <b>Show affected members in conflicts view</b> option to apply conversion with notification about encapsulation violation issues</li>
  <li>Choose <b>Convert silently</b> option to apply conversion silently whether encapsulation violation issues exist or not</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <b>Suppress conversion if class is annotated by</b> list to suppress the conversion of classes annotated by certain annotation names or its containing packages.
</p>
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 16 or higher.</p>
