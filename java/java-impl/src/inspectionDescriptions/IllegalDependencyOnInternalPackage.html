Reports references in modules without <code>module-info.java</code> on packages which are not exported from named modules. 
<p>Such configuration may occur when some modules in the project are already migrated to java modules but others are still non-modular.
By the analogy to the JDK, such non-modular code should not get access to the code in named modules which is not explicitly exported.</p>
