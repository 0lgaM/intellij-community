Reports fields in LocalQuickFix implementations that prevent intention preview action to function properly.
<p>
  Intention preview is an IntelliJ platform feature that displays how quick-fix or intention action
  will change the current file when applied. To implement this, a <code>LocalQuickFix#generatePreview</code>
  is called with a custom ProblemDescriptor that points to the non-physical copy of current file.
  Normally, it just delegates to <code>LocalQuickFix#applyFix</code>. However, some quick-fixes
  may refer directly or indirectly to physical elements and use them for writing. As a result,
  preview won't work, as the quick-fix will attempt to update physical PSI instead of non-physical one.
  To avoid this, default implementation of <code>generatePreview</code> delegates only if all the
  instance fields of a quick-fix class have safe types: primitives, Strings, etc.
</p>
<p>
  You may fix this problem in a number of ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    If the field does not actually store any PSI reference, or that PSI is used only for reading,
    you may annotate the field with <code>@SafeFieldForPreview</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    You may override <code>getFileModifierForPreview</code> method and create a copy of the quick-fix
    rebinding it to the non-physical file copy which is supplied as a parameter. Use
    <code>PsiTreeUtil#findSameElementInCopy</code> to find the corresponding PSI elements inside the
    supplied non-physical copy.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may override <code>generatePreview</code> method and provide completely custom preview behavior.
    For example, it's possible to display a custom HTML document instead of actual preview if your action
    does something besides modifying a current file.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This inspection does not report if you have a custom implementation of <code>getFileModifierForPreview</code>
  or <code>generatePreview</code>. However, this doesn't mean that the implementation is correct and preview works.
  Please test. Also note that preview result is calculated in background thread, so you cannot start a write action
  during the preview or do any operation that requires a write action. Finally, no preview is generated automatically
  if <code>startInWriteAction</code> returns false. In this case, having custom <code>generatePreview</code>
  implementation is desired.
