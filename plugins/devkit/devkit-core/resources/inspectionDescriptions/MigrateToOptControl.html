Reports <code>createOptionsPanel()</code> methods in inspection implementation, which can be
automatically converted to <code>getOptionsPane()</code>.
<p>
  Creating inspection options control via <code>createOptionsPanel()</code> is deprecated,
  in favor of declarative control description <code>getOptionsPane()</code>.
  In some cases, it's possible to convert the code automatically. In these cases,
  inspection will suggest to perform this conversion.
