<p>Detects usage of configuration methods that were deprecated.<br>

  Configuration methods may be deprecated because of two possible reasons:
  <ul>
  <li>The Gradle API has evolved, so old method choices should be avoided;</li>
  <li>Some plugin provides a better version of the deprecated configuration method.</li>
  </ul>
  Most likely there will be an alternative for the deprecated method.
